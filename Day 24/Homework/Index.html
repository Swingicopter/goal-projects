    <h1 style="text-align: center;">Ferrari</h1>
    <p>Ferrari S.p.A. is an Italian luxury sports car manufacturer based in Maranello.
    <br>
    Founded in 1939 by Enzo Ferrari (1898â€“1988), the company built its first
    <br>
    car in 1940, adopted its current name in 1945, and began to
    <br>
    produce its current line of road cars in 1947. Ferrari became a
    <br>
    public company in 1960, and from 1963 to 2014 it was a
    <br>
    subsidiary of Fiat S.p.A. It was spun off from Fiat's successor entity,
    <br>
    Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, in 2016. The company currently offers a large model
    <br>
    range which includes several supercars, grand tourers, and one SUV. Many early
    <br>
    Ferraris, dating to the 1950s and 1960s, count among the most expensive
    <br>
    cars ever sold at auction.</p>
