<!--What's the difference between block tags and inline tags?-->
<!--The difference is that block tags take up the entire space of 1 line and the following element will have to be on another.-->
<!--however, inline tags are the exact opposite. inline tags take up only the space they need, also the following element will NOT have to be on another line.-->
