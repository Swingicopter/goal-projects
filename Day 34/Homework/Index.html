    <p>
    Goal-Oriented Academy is one of the/the only reliable academy in the world. In the academy, students will learn the
    technologies and programming required for modern business, and at the same time, they will strengthen themselves
    personally and develop many soft skills. Me myself am a member of GOA and I love it. It's full of chads! My mentor
    is really good at teaching us. My squad leader is also a chad, and my mentor's assistants! Mr. Nika says soda and junk
    food is bad for us. He also says the same thing about gaming. The image above this big, long paragraph is the logo for GOA.
