        I learn at Millennium School.
        <br>
        When I wrote this website chain it was my 1st week of 7th grade.
        <br>
        7th grade has lots of new things such as:
    </p>
    <br><br><br>
    <ul style="color: white;">
        <li>No more free food</li>
        <li>New cafeteria hours</li>
        <li>New subjects</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 style="color: white; text-align: center;">Other Education</h2>
    <h3 style="color: white; text-align: center;">Goal-Oriented Academy</h3>
    <p style="color: white;">
        This is GOA, the only reliable academy in Georgia.
        <br>
        Here you can learn programming! You begin with Python and HTML (Hypertext Markup Language).
        Then you finish HTML and from there you learn CSS (Cascading Styling Sheets).
        I don't know what happens after that because I never finished Python and CSS.
        <br>
        There is an event called Hackathon (I'm attending the 6th hackathon on september 22).
        You answer questions on kahoot, along with your group and other chads.
        This academy also teaches you how to become a chad!
        I just love this academy!
